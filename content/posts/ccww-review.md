Finally got a smoker.  It took me long enough too, but I just didn't want to shell out
the cash.  And anyways I didn't think that tending a fire all day long sounded that fun,
no matter how much I like the taste of barbecue.

Good thing they have pellet grills.  Makes it a lot easier for lazy jerks like me.  I
didn't want to get one for a while because, well, it just didn't seem right.  Got a
little voice in the back of my head saying it's a cheater's way, but damn those little
voices and damn the purists!  I want delicious smoked meats and I don't want to spend
all day (or all night) tending a fire.

## Initial impressions

My wife wanted me to get a Traeger, which makes since because they're the biggest name
in the game.  Me, I always think when you buy a big name you're just paying for the
name.  But I didn't wanna go too cheap.  It looked like this Camp Chef Woodwind was well
reviewed.  So I went out and got it.

At first glance, I can tell we're not paying for looks.  This thing is kinda ugly.  At
the store they even had this blanket thing that was supposed to provide extra
insulation, but it looked even worse.  Looked like it came from a child's Etsy shop.

But I'm not buying this thing for it's looks.  I wanted to see how it performs.
