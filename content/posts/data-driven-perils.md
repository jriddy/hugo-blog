Is it a clich√© yet that all tech companies seek to be data-driven?  If not, it should
be.  Your average tech exec certainly wouldn't want to be caught _not_ data-driven,
following some squishy humanistic _narrative_ over _cold, hard logical facts_.  At
least, not unless they had some guiding philosophy that suggested otherwise.

This desire to be (or at least _appear to be_) data-driven does little to change what
decisions are made at these organizations, and usually only exists to defend management
from criticism.
