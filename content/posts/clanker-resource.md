In case you've been living under a rock for the past few months, the internet has taken to calling all chatbots, robots, and all other attempts at non-human autonomy _clankers_, as a slur.  As a vehicle of expressing hate, it's got a lot going for it.  It has not one but two /k/ sounds, which we all know is the funniest sound.  It reminds you of broken devices driving you insane with their incessant noise.  It's easy to say in anger, with the nasaly central vowel able to carry a lot of venom as you enunciate the word.  _Goddamn clankers again_, you can imagine saying, with all the vitriol you can muster.

It's not the only anti-robot slur to come out of this rising tide of _robophobia_ on the internet.  I'm not going to list them all here, because some veer too close to slurs for certain types of humans, but I will mention _tinskin_ and _cogsucker_ as personal favorites, although the latter seems more appropriate for someone who is overly fond of robots.

To say anti-AI sentiment is high would be an understatement.  Folks are exhausted of having half-baked generative AI shoved in their faces at every turn.  Nobody wants to talk to Samantha, your AI assistant.  No one has ever wanted an AI washing machine.  No normal, well-adjusted human being with friends, family, hobbies, a functioning moral compass, and a favorite flavor of ice cream can hear the word _agentic_ and take it seriously.  Which makes it confusing and infuriating that there's a whole class of people who think all of this is a great idea.

Yet instead of directing our frustration that those people, it seems easier to direct the hate at the _bots_.  Robophobia is definitely funnier, in post-ironic sort of way.  It's edgy in that it co-opts shocking and hateful tactics from _actual racism_ but directs it at what is essentially an acceptable target.  It's ironic in that you can say that you're only using the hate language in gest, but post-ironic in that you really do hate the bots.  But it's still misdirected.

The bots are not alive.  The AI is not taking our jobs.  This current generation of technology will not do what its most ardent promoters claim it will do, and we have little to worry from the technology itself.  What we should be afraid of is the techno-executive-investor class that has so gleefully embraced the notion of _ending human labor as we know it_.

Ideas:

- Robophobia is funny in a post-ironic way, but it misses the point.
- Generative AI is not replacing workers en masse in most fields.
- But it does reveal the mindset of decision makers in business and public life, who are champing at the bit to get rid of the pesky inconvenience of employing people
- The executive-investor class has a reductive and myopic view of knowledge work
- I am not a Marxist, but this is definitely a class issue, not a technology one
- Even if the reaction is a bit misdirected, its positive that people see this stuff as a threat, and not as some herald of a bright future
- Neoluddism is a reasonable response, but smashing the bots will not save us
- We need to lose our societal patience for technology overlords.  Stop buying corporate lies.  Start organizing against this.
- We need a slur for the executive-investor class instead
