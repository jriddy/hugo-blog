I live in a part of the world where "barbecue" usually means an apparatus for cooking
food over flame.  Nothing wrong with this, of course--words mean different things to
different people--but growing up we would have laughed at people that used the word that
way.  _Don't they know about **real** barbecue?_.  It always felt good to smirk at silly
yanks who didn't know barbecue from grilling.  _Real_ barbecue, we would have it, is
meat, typically a tough cut, cooked low and slow on indirect, smoky heat.  Grill food
is good, but it could never be _barbecue_, because barbecue is special and it is ours.

Of course, this kinda gatekeeping and pedestal-placing-uponning can easily result in a
sort of religion developing.  And sure enough, you don't have to look hard to find
evidence of a certain _cult of barbecue_ out there.  I admit to having fallen victim to
this a bit myself.  If I wanted to make real barbecue, I'd have to learn to make a real
fire that stayed at a real good smoke temperature for a real long time.  And I'd need
to do this in a real pit with real wood.

As it turns out, it's really hard to keep a stable fire for the 6 - 18 hours it takes to
smoke most things, and it makes it hard to do anything else.  It's not like I have
nothing else to do all day.

## Pellet Grills

A pellet grill of course solves these problems.
